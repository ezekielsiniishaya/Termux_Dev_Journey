    <div class="content"><h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <p>"The global water crisis, driven by population growth, urbanization, and unsustainable practices, demands urgent conservation measures to mitigate scarcity. Pollution, exacerbated by industrial discharge and agricultural runoff, threatens water sources and human health. Climate change intensifies challenges with extreme weather events, amplifying strain on resources. Lack of awareness impedes mitigation efforts. Education and outreach are critical to fostering conservation and safeguarding water for future generations."</p>
        <ol><li><strong>Climate Change Impact on Water:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Problem: Climate change exacerbates water-related challenges, leading to intensified extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.</li>
                <li>Impact: These events disrupt water availability and distribution, causing both immediate crises and long-term strain on water resources.</li>
            </ul>
           <li><strong> Industrial Water Waste:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem: Industrial activities contribute significantly to water pollution through the discharge of harmful effluents and chemicals into water bodies.</li>
                <li>Impact: This pollution contaminates water sources, jeopardizing ecosystems, human health, and the sustainability of water supplies.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem: Pollution from various sources, including agricultural runoff and plastic waste, poses a significant threat to water quality and ecosystem health.</li>
                <li>Impact: Contaminated water sources endanger aquatic life, compromise drinking water safety, and exacerbate health risks for communities reliant on polluted water.</li>

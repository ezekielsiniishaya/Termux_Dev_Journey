        the water industry
        andminimizing water waste.
        Currently, 3 out of 10 people do not have access to clean drinking water, and many communities are
        threatened by water
        scarcity, which continue to worsen due to increasing population growth and climate change. Only 1% of
        the Earthâ€™s water
        is freshwater, therefore it needs to be managed properly and conserved...<a href="" class="read">Read

                        "The global water crisis, driven by population growth,
                        urbanization, and unsustainable practices, demands urgent
                        conservation measures to mitigate scarcity. Pollution,
                        exacerbated by industrial discharge and agricultural runoff,
                        threatens water sources and human health. Climate change
                        intensifies challenges with extreme weather events, amplifying
                        strain on resources. Lack of awareness impedes mitigation
                        efforts. Education and outreach are critical to fostering
                        conservation and safeguarding water for future
